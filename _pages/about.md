Computer scientist with 6+ years of experience in NLP & AI research. I was involved in several EU-funded projects, including Horizon 2020, ERC and EU Erasmus Traineeship. I mainly focus on applying AI to mental health and behaviour change, and evaluating its safety and controllability. I have extensive experience on human evaluation of AI.

Currently, I'm a postdoc at the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics (UFAL), at Charles University (CZ). I work within the ERC-funded "NG-NLG" project, covering controllability of neural approaches to text generation.

Prior to this, I worked on efficient healthcare communication as a Marie-Curie ESR at University of Aberdeen (UK), and on unsupervised NLP and business-oriented data mining at Università degli studi di Cagliari (IT).
