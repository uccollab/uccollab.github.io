I'm a computer scientist with a passion for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and language. I'm mainly interested into applying AI to behaviour change, and inspecting AI safety.

Currently, I'm a postdoc at the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics (UFAL), at Charles University (CZ). I work within the ERC-funded "NG-NLG" project, covering controllability of neural approaches to text generation.

Prior to this, I worked on efficient healthcare communication as a Marie-Curie ESR at University of Aberdeen (UK), and on unsupervised NLP and business-oriented data mining at Università degli studi di Cagliari (IT).
