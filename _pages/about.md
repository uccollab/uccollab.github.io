I'm a computer scientist with a passion for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and language. I'm mainly interested into applying AI to behaviour change, and inspecting AI safety.

At the moment, I'm a postdoc at the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics (UFAL), at Charles University (CZ). I work within the ERC-funded "NG-NLG" project, covering controllability of neural approaches to text generation.

Prior to this, I worked on healthcare applications of Natural Language Generation (NLG) as a Marie-Curie ESR at University of Aberdeen (UK), and on unsupervised knowledge extraction from text and business-oriented data mining at Università degli studi di Cagliari (IT).

Prior to this, I was a Marie-Curie ESR at University of Aberdeen, within the Horizon 2020 "PhilHumans" project. I worked on Natural Language Generation, focusing on tailored, persuasive communication in healthcare applied to nutrition and mental health. 

Prior to this, I completed both my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in computing science at Università degli studi di Cagliari (Italy). I worked within the OKGraph and DoUtDes funded projects.-->
