      value: Simone Balloccu is a researcher with deep interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) applied to natural language and Human Computer Interaction (HCI).<br><br> He currently is a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistic, at Charles University (CZ). He works within the ERC-funded "NG-NLG" project, covering explainability and controllability of large language models. <br><br> Previously, he was a Marie-Curie Early Stage Researcher (ESR) at University of Aberdeen (UK), within the Horizon 2020 "Philhumans" project. There, he worked on using Natural Language Generation (NLG) and Conversational AI for tailored healthcare communication and counselling. <br><br>He completed his Bachelor's and Master's Degree in Computer Science at Università Degli Studi di Cagliari (IT), where he also did research on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Business-oriented data mining. Within the "OKGraph" project, he worked on unsupervised language modelling for knowledge extraction from unstructured text. Within the "DoUtDes" project, he focused on effectively mining and visualising data from companies' social media platforms.
