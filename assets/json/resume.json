    "Bio": "Simone Balloccu is a researcher with deep interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) applied to natural language and Human Computer Interaction (HCI).<br><br> He currently covers the role of postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistic, at Charles University (CZ). He works within the ERC-funded 'NG-NLG' project, covering controllability of neural approaches to text generation. <br><br> Previously, he was a Marie-Curie Early Stage Researcher (ESR) at University of Aberdeen (UK), within the Horizon 2020 \"Philhumans\" project, investigating the use of Natural Language Generation (NLG) and Conversational AI for tailored healthcare. <br><br>He completed his Bachelor's and Master's Degree in Computer Science at Università Degli Studi di Cagliari (IT), where he also did research on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Business-oriented data mining. Within the \"OKGraph\" project, he worked on unsupervised language modelling for knowledge extraction from unstructured text. Within the \"DoUtDes\" project, he focused on effectively mining and visualising data from companies' social media platforms.",
